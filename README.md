To make our stunting app more advanced, we implemented key features such as a Stunting Calculator, which uses data-driven algorithms to monitor children's growth and identify early signs of stunting by comparing it with standardized growth charts. Additionally, the app includes Personalized Nutritional Recommendations powered by machine learning, offering tailored meal plans based on the childâ€™s age, weight, and specific nutritional needs. To enhance awareness, we integrated Comprehensive Stunting Information, providing verified and easy-to-understand content about the causes, risks, and prevention of stunting, empowering parents and caregivers with essential knowledge.
